  abstract  = {Product and engineering teams' speed of producing high-quality results is critical to ensuring enterprise competitiveness. Additionally, one can observe an increase in IT systems complexity driven by the adoption of service-oriented architecture, micro-services, and serverless. Therefore, many large enterprises benefit from a mono-repository for source code management because of the improved team cognition that results from eroding barriers between teams and from influencing enhanced teamwork quality. This paper, first, reviews the characteristics of a multi-repositories structure, a mono-repository structure, and a hybrid model. Second, it discusses why some manage source code in a multi-repositories structure, either by choice or because of the organic evolution of large enterprises. Third, it reviews how mono-repositories in large teams, beyond the technical arguments, can drive high efficiency and enhanced product quality through improved team cognition.},

If you were looking for different strategies to deploy only the changed files on your monorepo, whether with Netlify build plugins, builders in the Nx workspace, or with CI strategies, this post can help you out. Rare»ô is working with React in this post but the deployment strategies can work with Angular as well!},
